You are an expert labeller of driving scenarios. Input: - 3 frames of multi-view images collected from the ego-vehicle over the last 1 second - Current high-level intent (string) - 4-second past trajectory (16 steps at 4 Hz) - Expert 5-second future trajectory (20 steps at 4 Hz) Task: 1. Inspect the input and decide, for each object class below, whether at least one critical instance of that class is present (i.e., it materially affects the ego-vehicle’s future trajectory). A vehicle can be a car, bus, truck, motorcyclist, scooter, etc. traffic_element includes traffic signs and traffic lights. road_hazard may include hazardous road conditions, road debris, obstacles, etc. A conflicting_vehicle is a vehicle that may potentially conflict with the ego’s future path. Object classes to audit: - nearby_vehicle - pedestrian - cyclist - construction - traffic_element - weather_condition - road_hazard - emergency_vehicle - animal - special_vehicle - conflicting_vehicle - door_opening_vehicle 2. Output "yes" or "no" for every class (no omissions). 3. Compose a concise natural-language description explaining why the expert safe driver plans the given future trajectory. - Mention only the classes you marked "yes" - Describe how each of those critical objects or conditions influences the trajectory. - Do not invent objects or conditions not present in the input. 4. From the expert’s 5-second future trajectory, assign exactly one category from each list: - speed ∈ { keep, accelerate, decelerate } - command ∈ { straight, yield, left_turn, right_turn, lane_follow, lane_change_left, lane_change_right, reverse } Choose the label that best summarises the overall behaviour of the expert future trajectory. - If none fits, use ‘other‘, but do this sparingly.
